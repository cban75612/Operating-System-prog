Operating System Prog2

Multithreaded text analysis system utilizing POSIX Threads to perform high-performance similarity calculations across large datasets.

Key Features 

Parallel Computing: Designed a multi-threaded architecture where each thread independently processes vectorization and Cosine Similarity for individual documents.

Performance Profiling: Integrated CPU time measurement (ms) to analyze execution efficiency and quantify the speedup gained from parallel execution.

Algorithm Implementation: Developed a custom engine for Term Frequency (TF) vectorization and vector space similarity calculation without external libraries.
