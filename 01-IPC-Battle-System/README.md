Operating-System-Prog1

This project demonstrates core Operating System concepts by simulating a multi-process battle system. The primary focus is on managing Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and ensuring data consistency under strict synchronization constraints.

Key Features & Technologies

Process Generation: Implemented a parent-child architecture using the fork() system call to simulate independent entities.

POSIX Shared Memory: Implemented POSIX Shared Memory as the primary IPC mechanism for seamless data synchronization of coordinates and process status.
